# Sumo Bot ‚Äî Autonomous & Remote-Controlled Robot

## Overview

This project is an **autonomous competitive sumo robot** built using the ATmega32 microcontroller. The robot supports both **autonomous** and **manual remote-control modes**, leveraging IR sensors for edge detection, opponent tracking, and user input. It was designed for real-time decision-making in sumo-style competitions.
